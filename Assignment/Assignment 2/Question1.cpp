// What’ll be the output of the following programs :

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() 
{
int x = 2, y = 5;
int exp1 = (x * y / x);
int exp2 = (x * (y / x));
cout << exp1 << ",";
cout << exp2 << "\n";
}

// if the precedence is same then we have to go left to right in g++ compiler I don't have idea about gcc compiler.
