/*Write a C++ program that takes a year from the user and print whether
that year is a leap year or not.

Hint : A leap year is exactly divisible by 4 except for century years (years ending with
00). The century year is a leap year only if it is perfectly divisible by 400.
Eg : 1999 is not a leap year
2000 is a leap year
2004 is a leap year*/
